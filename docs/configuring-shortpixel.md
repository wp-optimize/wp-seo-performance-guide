## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Check Optimization Status

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Images Not Being Optimized

If images aren't being optimized:

1. Check your API key is valid in **Settings → ShortPixel**.
2. Ensure "Background Processing" is enabled.
3. Verify server requirements (PHP version, memory limit).

### WebP/AVIF Images Not Displaying

If next-gen images aren't showing:

1. Check browser compatibility (older browsers don't support WebP/AVIF).
2. Verify the delivery method is correctly configured.
3. Clear your browser cache and Cloudflare cache.

### Conflicts with Other Plugins

If you experience conflicts:

1. Temporarily disable other image optimization plugins.
2. Check for caching plugin conflicts and purge caches after changing settings.

## Conclusion

With ShortPixel properly configured, your WordPress site will load faster and provide a better user experience. The optimized images will also help improve your Core Web Vitals scores, particularly Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), which is crucial for SEO.

Remember to periodically check your ShortPixel dashboard to monitor usage and ensure all images are being optimized correctly.
